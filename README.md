# Traffic_Sign_Recognition
In line with the developments in artificial intelligence technologies, many large companies such as Tesla, Google, Ford, Audi, Mercedes-Benz are working on autonomous vehicles. 
The aim here is that vehicles can interpret traffic signs and make decisions. In this project, a convolutional neural network model that can classify the relevant traffic signs in different categories will be created. 
Thanks to this model, it is aimed to recognize the traffic signs by the autonomous vehicle by performing the classification of traffic signs, which is a very important task for all autonomous vehicles. Besides, a GUI has built with Tkinter. 
The targeted accuracy is 95%.
Steps are given as follows:
- Explore the dataset
- Build a CNN model
- Train and validate the model
- Test the model with test dataset
